> [!tldr] Main Idea
> Ideally make this atomic and self-contained (i.e. one idea per note, written down so it still makes sense a year from now).

Elaborate here if you want. Else, delete the "Main Idea" callout and just write here.
## Related Notes
Mention notes that are related and why (e.g. similar idea, opposing idea, logical relation between both, etc.)
## References
List sources here when appropriate. Can be literature notes or plain links.
