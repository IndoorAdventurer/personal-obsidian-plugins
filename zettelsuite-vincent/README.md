# ZettelSuite Plugin
This Obsidian plugin should remove friction within my Zettelkasten approach. It has the following features:
 - A side panel to quickly create a MOC, fleeting note, permanent note or literature note.
   - For literature notes, you may simply add a BibTex reference and an optional link to a pdf, and it will handle the rest for you (naming, filling out relevant yaml fields, etc.).
 - Extra context menu options when you right-click on a non existing note to add it as a MOC, fleeting note or permanent note directly.
 - A command `Open Zettelsuite Panel` you can choose via the `ctrl+P` panel to open the side panel if you closed it.
